My Learning Journey

Hi there! I'm Tomas, and I embarked on my coding journey in April 2023 with absolutely no prior experience. I've created this GitHub repository to showcase the small projects I've been working on as part of my practice and learning process.

My learning resources include platforms like freecodecamp.org, codecademy.com, scriba.com, and YouTube, among others.
Learning to code has been a challenging but rewarding experience, and I'm fully committed to it. 
I believe in showing up every day, no matter how long it takes. If it takes 10 years - let it be 10 years! 
You can bet I'll see it through.

I'm currently diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and aspire to be a Front-End Developer.

Feel free to explore my projects, and thank you for joining me on this exciting coding journey!
